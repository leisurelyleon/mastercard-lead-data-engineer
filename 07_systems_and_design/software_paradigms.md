Software Engineering Paradigms

An overview of common development and operational paradigms used in large-scale software systems.

1. Waterfall

A linear, sequential approach: requirements → design → implementation → verification → maintenance.

2. Agile

An iterative approach emphasizing collaboration, feedback, and small, rapid releases (e.g., Scrum, Kanban).

3. DevOps

Bridges development and operations with practices like CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and frequent deployments.

4. Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Automated building, testing, and deployment pipelines to ensure code changes are integrated and released rapidly.

5. Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

Applies software engineering to operations: service level objectives (SLOs), error budgets, and automation.

6. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Write tests before code to drive design, ensure coverage, and enable safe refactoring.

7. Microservices Architecture

Decompose applications into small, loosely coupled services, each running in its own process and communicating via APIs.

8. Event-Driven Architecture

Components communicate by producing and consuming events, enabling asynchronous, decoupled systems.

9. Serverless Computing

Run code without managing servers; functions are executed on-demand and billed per execution.

10. Twelve-Factor App

A methodology for building scalable, maintainable SaaS applications: codebase, dependencies, config, backing services, etc.
